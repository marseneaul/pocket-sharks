# Shark Evolutions - Game Design Specification

## Overview

**Title:** Shark Evolutions (working title: "Curryshark")

**Genre:** Pokémon-style creature collection RPG focused entirely on sharks, rays, and other cartilaginous fish.

**Core Premise:** The player is an aspiring marine biologist who progressively gains diving certifications to explore deeper waters, encountering and catching sharks while uncovering and ultimately stopping a criminal organization called Team Finn.

---

## Core Gameplay Loop

### Progression System: Diving Certifications

The player's ability to explore is gated by diving certifications, which replace traditional HMs/abilities:

| Certification Level | Areas Accessible | How Obtained |
|---------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Wading/Snorkeling | Shallow waters, tide pools, beaches | Start of game |
| Open Water SCUBA | Reefs to ~60ft, basic ocean areas | Hawaii visit (story) |
| Advanced SCUBA | Deeper reefs, wrecks, night diving | Caribbean (story) |
| Tech Diving | Deep wrecks, cave systems | Europe (story) |
| Open Ocean Swimming | Pelagic encounters, crossing regions | Cape Town (story) |
| Submarine | Abyssal depths, deep trenches | Late game unlock |

**Additionally:** Fishing can be used to catch certain deep/pelagic species from shore or boat.

## Story & Villain

### Team Finn / Finnova Biotech

**Public Front:** "Finnova Biotech" or "Finn Futures Foundation" - a company that claims to be ending wild shark finning by developing sustainable fin farming and medical collagen products.

**Secret Operations:**
- Harvesting wild shark fins while laundering them through "farms"
- Genetic engineering experiments to resurrect Megalodon for its massive fins
- Operating massive fin collection operations visible as boats loaded with fins

**Story Progression (tied to certifications):**

1. **Wading/Shallows:** Player notices local shark disappearances, injured sharks, fin piles washing up on beaches
2. **Basic SCUBA:** Discover "fin collection rigs" underwater; find tagged sharks with surgical scars
3. **Advanced SCUBA:** Reef nurseries being raided - eggs stolen, juveniles missing
4. **Sub/Deepsea:** Find the genetics lab and the "Megalodon cradle" (fossil DNA extraction site)

**Moral Complexity:** Some towns support Team Finn because they bring jobs and economic opportunity.

## Fossil Resurrection System

**Deep-Sea Cryo-Amber**
A freak geologic setting creates brine-filled, subzero pockets in abyssal sediments. Volcanic ash layers and unusual minerals seal the fossils in oxygen-free capsules. Inside, tissues are "pickled" and radiation-shielded. Scientists recover fragmentary DNA and use computational reconstruction plus close living relatives.


### Fossils Available
| Fossil | Result | Location Found |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Swirl Fossil | Helicoprion (Fossil/Steel) | Caribbean diving |
| Wing Fossil | Aquilolamna (Fossil/Flying) | Caribbean diving |
| Megalodon Tooth | Megalodon (Fossil/Leviathan) | Abyssal Trench (post-boss) |

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Seasonal/Time-Based Encounters
Many sharks should only appear at certain times:
- Silky/Blue/Mako/Smooth Hammerhead: Seasonal in Cabo
- Tiger Shark: October in French Polynesia / Hawaii
- Broadnose Sevengill: Spring only in San Diego
- Whale Shark: Time-of-year dependent in multiple regions

### Regional Variants
- Mexican Horn Shark (Cabo variant of Horn Shark)
- Consider variants based on real geographic differences in species

### Encounter Methods
- Wading/Tide pools
- Snorkeling
- SCUBA diving (various depths)
- Night diving
- Open ocean swimming
- Fishing from shore
- Fishing from boat
- Submarine exploration

### Environmental Messages
- Europe: Overfishing has devastated populations
- Cape Town: Ecosystem collapse without apex predators
- Asia: Industrial scale of fin trade
- Multiple regions: Conservation permits, research tagging

---

## UI/UX Considerations

### Certification UI
Display current certification level and what it unlocks. Show preview of locked areas.

### Sharkedex
- Scientific name for each species
- Real conservation status
- Habitat information
- Size comparison

### Map System
- World map with region travel
- Local maps with dive sites
- Depth indicator for current exploration capability

---

## Audio/Visual Notes

### Environment Themes
- Shallow: Bright, warm colors, filtered sunlight
- Reef: Colorful, busy, coral backdrops
- Open Ocean: Blue gradient, sense of vast empty space
- Deep: Dark blue to black, bioluminescence
- Abyssal: Near-black, submarine lights only

### Encounter Animations
Consider unique encounter animations for different methods (swimming vs fishing vs submarine spotting)
